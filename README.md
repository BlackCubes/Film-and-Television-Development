# Film-and-Television-Development

What's up everyone! This is a producing course which is title "FILM TV 183A - Producing I: Film and Television Development" held at UCLA which I took as an undergraduate for my minor on Film, Television, and Digital Media.

The course description is such that it is a critical analysis of contemporary entertainment industries and practical approach to understanding and implementing producer's role in development of feature film and television scripts. Through scholarly and trade journal readings, in-class discussions, script analysis, and select guest speakers, exposure to various entities that comprise feature film and television development process. Basic introduction to story and exploration of proper technique for evaluating screenplays and teleplays through writing of coverage.

Please do look through some of the folders which have the assignments/homeworks in PDF and Excel given from the teacher to complete, my coverages and attachment lists in PDF format, and my pitch for a particular screenplay given from the teacher along with my attachment lists to complete as a final.

Any questions or comments are highly appreciated! Thanks, and enjoy looking through my files!
