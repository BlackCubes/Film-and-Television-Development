# Pitch

Good day ladies and gentlemen! I hope that everyone is having a great time in their lives!

Here is an assignment that was given in class by the professor in order to complete for the Final. We were paired up randomly with another student, and we were assigned screenplays to do the pitch where we were not given a title for it. We also had to create lists for talent attachments which we thought would fit the screenplay, and we also had to do a pitch in front of class with a guest speaker from the industry. The folder called "Lists" contains the list attachments.

My assigments were done in Word and exported in PDF format. I have also provided the pairings from the professor in Excel sheet and I exported it in PDF format.
