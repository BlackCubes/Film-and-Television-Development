# Coverages and Lists

Good day ladies and gentlemen! I hope that everyone is having a great time in their lives!

Here are the assignments that was given in class by the professor in order to complete. We had to read the screenplays given by the professor, write coverages on them, and on one of them we had to create lists for our choices of talents to be attached. Each of these folders contains the screenplays and coverages for the four films and television shows where "Cloud 9" has the lists.

My assigments were done in Word and exported in PDF format.
